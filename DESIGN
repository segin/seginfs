seginfs design and implementation
=================================

seginfs is a simplistic-ish 64-bit file system. Following the Unix concept of
"everything is a file", the key design element is that all filesystem
structures will also be recorded in the inode table and in the extents table,
including the inode and extents tables themselves. Extents-based allocation is
used (like in ext4, reiserfs4, Apple's HFS and HFS+, Microsoft's NTFS, list
goes on) to simplify the computation of file data locations. This also makes it
rather easy to grow the tables and their bitmaps simply by adding a new extent,
or simply increasing the run-length of the current one if possible (to keep
data contigious)

seginfs is primarily a Unix file system, although it's intended structural
flexibility will allow for use on non-Unix systems, such as Microsoft Windows

Owing to ext2, a minimum number of blocks will always be restricted to
exclusive use by uid 0 (root, the superuser).
