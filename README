seginfs - an unexciting filesystem
==================================

seginfs is a pretty mundane filesystem written by a guy that has no prior
experience writing or working on filesystems.

The filesystem is basically a design idea I had put into code format, or
at least, that's what I'm going to try to do, if I don't abandon it.

Every element of the filesystem will also be a file; the superblock,
block bitmap, inode bitmap, inode table, extents bitmap, and extents table,
will all be, themselves, files, and refereced in the inode table.

Access control lists will not be initially implemented due to inexperience
with anything but Windows NT ACLs, which aren't very useful for a filesystem
desgined for POSIX-ish operating systems.

Initially, I will implement it using FUSE, with vfs interfaces for other OSes
coming Real Soon Now (TM).
